![MNIST Digits Example](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MnistExamples.png)

This project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed to classify handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** with high accuracy. Built using **PyTorch**, the model achieves a classification accuracy of **99%**, showcasing robust performance through effective optimization techniques and data augmentation.

## Project Overview

### Objective
To design and train a neural network classifier capable of identifying handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. This classifier was evaluated on both the official dataset and additional handwritten digits generated by classmates during a final competition.

### Key Features
- **CNN Architecture**: Implements a multi-layer convolutional neural network for feature extraction and classification.
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances model robustness through transformations such as rotation, flipping, and scaling.
- **Iterative Optimization**: Fine-tunes hyperparameters and model architecture for improved performance.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a test accuracy of **98.9%** on the MNIST dataset.
- **Competition Ready**: Designed to classify digits in under 1 second.

## Dataset

The **MNIST dataset** consists of:
- **60,000 training images**: Used for training and validation.
- **10,000 test images**: Used for evaluation.

Each image is a 28x28 grayscale representation of a digit, paired with its corresponding label (0-9).

## Model Architecture

The CNN model includes the following layers:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features from the images.
2. **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform the final classification.
